# Operation-Driven Prerequisites Implementation - COMPLETION REPORT

## Executive Summary

✅ **ALL PHASES COMPLETED** - The execution refactoring described in `docs/dev/new-execution.md` has been fully implemented across all 7 phases. The synthfs codebase now uses a clean, operation-driven prerequisites design that provides better extensibility, testability, and maintainability.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Add Prerequisites to Core (COMPLETED)
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `pkg/synthfs/core/prerequisites.go` - Core interfaces defined
  - `pkg/synthfs/core/prerequisites_impl.go` - Concrete prerequisite types
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/base.go` - Default `Prerequisites()` method added
- **Key Changes:**
  - `Prerequisite` interface with `Type()`, `Path()`, `Validate()` methods
  - `PrerequisiteResolver` interface for creating operations to satisfy prerequisites
  - `ParentDirPrerequisite`, `NoConflictPrerequisite`, `SourceExistsPrerequisite` implementations
  - Clean separation in core package to avoid circular dependencies

### ✅ Phase 2: Operations Declare Prerequisites (COMPLETED)
- **Files Modified:**
  - All operation implementations in `pkg/synthfs/operations/`
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/create.go` - CreateFileOperation declares parent_dir + no_conflict prerequisites
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/directory.go` - CreateDirectoryOperation declares prerequisites
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/copy_move.go` - Copy/Move operations declare source_exists + destination prerequisites
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/delete.go` - Delete operations declare source_exists prerequisite
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/symlink.go` - Symlink operations declare prerequisites
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/archive.go` - Archive operations declare prerequisites
- **Testing:**
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/prerequisites_test.go` - Comprehensive unit tests for all prerequisite declarations

### ✅ Phase 3: Add Prerequisite Resolution to Pipeline (COMPLETED)
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `pkg/synthfs/execution/prerequisite_resolver.go` - Generic prerequisite resolver implementation
  - `pkg/synthfs/core/execution_types.go` - `ResolvePrerequisites` option added to `PipelineOptions`
  - Pipeline infrastructure updated to support prerequisite resolution
- **Key Features:**
  - Generic resolver that can create parent directory operations
  - Opt-in behavior through `ResolvePrerequisites` flag
  - Maintains backward compatibility

### ✅ Phase 4: Create SimpleBatch Alternative (COMPLETED)  
- **Files Created:**
  - `pkg/synthfs/batch/simple_batch.go` - Complete SimpleBatch implementation
- **Key Features:**
  - No hardcoded parent directory logic
  - Relies entirely on prerequisite resolution
  - Cleaner, more predictable behavior
  - `NewSimpleBatch()` constructor provided

### ✅ Phase 5: Migration Path (COMPLETED)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `pkg/synthfs/batch/batch.go` - Added `NewBatchWithSimpleBatch()` constructor
  - `pkg/synthfs/batch/interfaces.go` - Added `WithSimpleBatch()` method to interface
  - Migration path allows gradual adoption of new behavior

### ✅ Phase 6: Switch Defaults (COMPLETED)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `pkg/synthfs/batch.go` - Updated `NewBatch()` to use SimpleBatch by default
  - Added deprecation notices and migration guidance in documentation
  - `NewBatchWithSimpleBatch()` provided as explicit constructor
- **Behavior Change:**
  - New batches now use prerequisite resolution by default
  - Clean, predictable behavior for new code
  - Legacy behavior still available during transition

### ✅ Phase 7: Cleanup (COMPLETED)
- **Cleanup Performed:**
  - Unified batch implementation using prerequisite resolution
  - Removed redundant compatibility flags
  - Simplified codebase architecture
  - All tests updated to use new pattern

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### 1. ✅ Extensibility
- New operation types only need to implement `Prerequisites()` method
- No batch modifications required for new operations
- Clean extension points for custom operation types

### 2. ✅ Testability  
- Each component has single, clear responsibility
- Operations can be tested independently of batch logic
- Prerequisites can be validated in isolation

### 3. ✅ Maintainability
- No hardcoded operation type strings in batch implementation
- Generic prerequisite resolution eliminates operation-specific logic
- Clean separation of concerns across packages

### 4. ✅ Flexibility
- Operations can declare complex, custom prerequisites
- Prerequisite resolution is extensible
- Multiple resolution strategies can be implemented

## Package Structure (Circular Import Prevention)

The implementation successfully maintains the strict package hierarchy:

```
core/           (no imports from synthfs) ✅
    ↑
operations/     (imports core only) ✅  
    ↑
execution/      (imports core only) ✅
    ↑
batch/          (imports core, operations) ✅
    ↑
synthfs/        (imports all) ✅
```

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ **Batch no longer has hardcoded operation type strings**
2. ✅ **Operations explicitly declare all prerequisites**  
3. ✅ **New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline**
4. ✅ **All existing tests pass throughout migration**
5. ✅ **No circular import issues introduced**

## Testing Status

- ✅ All operation prerequisite declarations tested
- ✅ Prerequisite validation logic tested  
- ✅ Prerequisite resolution tested
- ✅ Integration tests for batch execution with prerequisites
- ✅ Migration path tested
- ✅ Backward compatibility verified
