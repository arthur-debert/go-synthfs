# Execution Refactoring - COMPLETED

**Status: REFACTORING COMPLETED ‚úÖ**

The execution refactoring has been successfully completed. All backwards compatibility code has been removed and the codebase now uses a single, clean implementation with automatic prerequisite resolution.

## Summary

The synthfs batch system has been refactored to use prerequisite-driven operation resolution. This eliminates hardcoded parent directory creation logic and provides a clean, extensible architecture.

## Final Implementation

- **Single Implementation**: Unified batch with prerequisite resolution enabled by default
- **Automatic Dependencies**: Operations declare prerequisites, system resolves them automatically  
- **Clean Architecture**: No feature flags, no migration paths, no legacy code
- **Extensible Design**: New operation types work automatically

## Current API

```go
// Create a new batch
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()

// Add operations - prerequisites resolved automatically
batch.CreateFile("deep/nested/file.txt", []byte("content"))
batch.CreateDir("another/path") 
batch.Copy("source.txt", "dest/target.txt")

// Execute with automatic dependency resolution
result, err := batch.Run()
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **üéØ Extensibility**: New operation types only need to implement `Prerequisites()` method
2. **üß™ Testability**: Clean separation of concerns between operation creation and execution
3. **üîß Maintainability**: Prerequisites are explicit and declarative  
4. **‚ö° Flexibility**: Operations can declare complex prerequisite requirements
5. **üîÑ Simplicity**: Single implementation path, no confusing options

## Removed Features

All backwards compatibility features have been removed:

- ‚ùå `UseSimpleBatch` flags and options
- ‚ùå Migration methods and constructors
- ‚ùå Legacy batch implementations
- ‚ùå Feature flags and runtime switches

## Prerequisites System

Operations declare what they need:

```go
func (op *CreateFileOperation) Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite {
    var prereqs []core.Prerequisite
    
    // Need parent directory to exist
    if filepath.Dir(op.path) != "." {
        prereqs = append(prereqs, core.NewParentDirPrerequisite(op.path))
    }
    
    // Need no conflict with existing files
    prereqs = append(prereqs, core.NewNoConflictPrerequisite(op.path))
    
    return prereqs
}
```

The execution pipeline automatically resolves them during `batch.Run()`.

## Result

The execution refactoring has delivered a significantly cleaner, more maintainable codebase with automatic prerequisite resolution for all filesystem operations.
