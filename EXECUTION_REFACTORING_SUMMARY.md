# Execution Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The operation-driven prerequisites design has been **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**. All 7 phases of the refactoring have been implemented, transforming synthfs from a hardcoded batch system to a clean, extensible prerequisite-based architecture.

## What Was Accomplished

### âœ… Phase 1: Add Prerequisites to Core (COMPLETED)
- Created `core/prerequisites.go` with Prerequisite and PrerequisiteResolver interfaces
- Created `core/prerequisites_impl.go` with concrete implementations:
  - `ParentDirPrerequisite` - ensures parent directories exist
  - `NoConflictPrerequisite` - prevents overwriting existing files
  - `SourceExistsPrerequisite` - validates source files exist
- Added `Prerequisites()` method to all operations
- Maintained backward compatibility - no breaking changes

### âœ… Phase 2: Operations Declare Prerequisites (COMPLETED)
- All operations now declare their specific prerequisites:
  - **CreateFileOperation**: Parent directory + no conflict
  - **CreateDirectoryOperation**: Parent directory (idempotent for existing dirs)
  - **CopyOperation**: Source exists + destination parent + no conflict at destination
  - **MoveOperation**: Same as copy operation
  - **DeleteOperation**: Source exists (for validation)
  - **CreateSymlinkOperation**: Parent directory + no conflict
  - **Archive operations**: Appropriate source/destination validation
- Enhanced operation validation with proper prerequisites

### âœ… Phase 3: Add Prerequisite Resolution to Pipeline (COMPLETED)
- Created `execution/prerequisite_resolver.go`
- Added `ResolvePrerequisites` option to `PipelineOptions`
- Prerequisite resolver can automatically create parent directory operations
- System validates prerequisites before execution
- Maintains existing behavior when resolution is disabled

### âœ… Phase 4: Create SimpleBatch Alternative (COMPLETED)
- Created `SimpleBatch` implementation without hardcoded logic
- SimpleBatch relies entirely on prerequisite resolution
- Clean separation between operation creation and prerequisite handling
- Preserved all existing batch functionality

### âœ… Phase 5: Migration Path (COMPLETED)
- Created `BatchOptions` with `UseSimpleBatch` flag
- Added migration methods: `WithSimpleBatch()`, `NewBatchWithOptions()`
- Backward-compatible defaults maintained
- Comprehensive test coverage for both execution paths

### âœ… Phase 6: Switch Defaults (COMPLETED)
- Changed default behavior to use prerequisite resolution
- `ResolvePrerequisites` defaults to `true`
- Added deprecation notices for legacy methods
- Updated internal usage to new patterns

### âœ… Phase 7: Cleanup (COMPLETED)
- Removed `UseSimpleBatch` compatibility flag from `PipelineOptions`
- Unified batch implementation always uses prerequisite resolution
- Simplified `BatchOptions` to only contain execution options
- Removed delegation logic and legacy method implementations
- Deprecated methods now redirect to modern equivalents

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Extensibility**: New operation types only need to implement `Prerequisites()` - no batch modification required
2. **ðŸ§ª Testability**: Each component has single responsibility and clear interfaces
3. **ðŸ”§ Maintainability**: No hardcoded operation knowledge in batch layer
4. **âš¡ Flexibility**: Operations can declare complex prerequisite requirements
5. **ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

## Architecture Improvements

### Before (Hardcoded)
```go
// Batch had hardcoded logic for each operation type
switch opType {
case "create_file":
    ensureParentDirectoryExists(parentDir) // Hardcoded!
case "create_directory": 
    ensureParentDirectoryExists(parentDir) // Duplicated!
}
```

### After (Declarative)
```go
// Operations declare what they need
func (op *CreateFileOperation) Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite {
    return []core.Prerequisite{
        core.NewParentDirPrerequisite(op.path),
        core.NewNoConflictPrerequisite(op.path),
    }
}

// Pipeline resolves generically
resolver.Resolve(prereq) // Creates parent dir operations automatically
```

## Success Criteria âœ…

All original success criteria have been achieved:

1. âœ… **Batch no longer has hardcoded operation type strings**
2. âœ… **Operations explicitly declare all prerequisites**  
3. âœ… **New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline**
4. âœ… **All existing tests pass throughout migration**
5. âœ… **No circular import issues introduced**

## Usage Examples

### Modern API (Recommended)
```go
// Simple usage - prerequisite resolution is automatic
batch := synthfs.NewBatch(fs, registry)
batch.CreateFile("deep/nested/file.txt", content)
batch.Run() // Automatically creates "deep/" and "deep/nested/" directories
```

### Legacy API (Still Supported)
```go
// Existing code continues to work unchanged
batch := synthfs.NewBatch(fs, registry)
batch.CreateDir("deep")
batch.CreateDir("deep/nested") 
batch.CreateFile("deep/nested/file.txt", content)
batch.Run()
```

## Migration Complete ðŸŽ‰

The synthfs execution system has been successfully transformed from a rigid, hardcoded architecture to a flexible, extensible, prerequisite-driven design. All phases have been completed with full backward compatibility maintained throughout the migration.

**Status**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**
