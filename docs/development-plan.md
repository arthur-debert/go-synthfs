# SynthFS Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the current state and future development strategy for the SynthFS library. The execution refactoring has been completed, resulting in a clean, unified implementation with prerequisite resolution.

## üéØ Current Architecture

### Clean Implementation Status ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Single, clean batch implementation with prerequisite resolution.

**Achievements:**

- ‚úÖ **Single BatchImpl**: Unified implementation with prerequisite resolution
- ‚úÖ **Removed backwards compatibility**: All feature flags and migration code removed
- ‚úÖ **Simplified interfaces**: Clean batch interface without legacy methods
- ‚úÖ **Prerequisite resolution**: Automatic dependency management for all operations
- ‚úÖ **Clean main API**: Direct access to implementation without wrapper layers

### Current Features

1. **Operations Supported:**
   - CreateDir, CreateFile, CreateSymlink
   - Copy, Move, Delete
   - CreateArchive, Unarchive
   - All with automatic prerequisite resolution

2. **Batch Execution:**
   - Single `NewBatch()` constructor returns clean implementation
   - Prerequisite resolution automatically resolves dependencies
   - Support for backup/restore operations
   - Comprehensive validation and error handling

3. **Clean Architecture:**
   - No feature flags or backwards compatibility code
   - Single execution path with prerequisite resolution
   - Simplified interfaces and documentation
