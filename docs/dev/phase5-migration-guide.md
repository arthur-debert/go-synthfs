# Phase 5 Migration Guide - COMPLETED

**Status: MIGRATION COMPLETED ✅**

This migration guide is now obsolete as the synthfs batch system has been consolidated into a single implementation with prerequisite resolution enabled by default.

## What Changed

The synthfs batch system no longer supports multiple modes. There is now only one implementation that:

1. **Uses prerequisite resolution automatically**: All operations get their prerequisites resolved during execution
2. **Provides clean architecture**: Operations declare what they need via `Prerequisites()` method
3. **Eliminates complexity**: No feature flags, no migration paths, no backwards compatibility layers

## Current API

```go
// Create a new batch - prerequisite resolution is automatic
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()

// Add operations - prerequisites will be resolved automatically
batch.CreateFile("path/to/file.txt", []byte("content"))

// Execute - parent directories created automatically if needed
result, err := batch.Run()
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Single implementation path
2. **Extensibility**: New operation types work automatically by implementing `Prerequisites()`
3. **Testability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Predictability**: Consistent behavior across all operations
5. **Performance**: No overhead from feature flags or compatibility layers

## Removed Features

The following migration-related features have been removed:

- ❌ **Legacy Mode**: Old hardcoded parent directory logic
- ❌ **SimpleBatch Mode**: Separate implementation
- ❌ **Feature Flags**: `UseSimpleBatch` and related options
- ❌ **Migration Methods**: `WithSimpleBatch()`, `NewBatchWithOptions()`, etc.
- ❌ **Compatibility Constructors**: `NewBatchWithSimpleBatch()` and similar

## Migration No Longer Needed

If you have existing code that was using the old migration methods, simply change:

```go
// OLD migration code (no longer needed)
batch := synthfs.NewBatchWithSimpleBatch()
// or
batch := synthfs.NewBatch().WithSimpleBatch(true)

// NEW simplified code
batch := synthfs.NewBatch() // Prerequisite resolution is now automatic
```

## Result

The codebase is significantly simpler and more maintainable with automatic prerequisite resolution for all filesystem operations.
