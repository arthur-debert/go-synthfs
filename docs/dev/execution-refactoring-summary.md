# Execution Refactoring Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of the operation-driven prerequisites design refactoring for synthfs execution system, as outlined in `new-execution.md`.

## Completed Work

### ✅ Phase 1: Add Prerequisites to Core (DONE)
- **Created**: `pkg/synthfs/core/prerequisites.go` with prerequisite interfaces
- **Created**: `pkg/synthfs/core/prerequisites_impl.go` with concrete implementations:
  - `ParentDirPrerequisite`
  - `NoConflictPrerequisite` 
  - `SourceExistsPrerequisite`
- **Updated**: All operation base classes to include `Prerequisites()` method
- **Result**: Prerequisite system foundation established without breaking changes

### ✅ Phase 2: Operations Declare Prerequisites (DONE)
- **Updated**: All operation types to declare their prerequisites:
  - `CreateFileOperation`, `CreateDirectoryOperation`: Parent directory + no conflict
  - `CopyOperation`, `MoveOperation`: Source exists + destination parent + no conflict
  - `DeleteOperation`: Source exists
  - `CreateSymlinkOperation`: Parent directory + no conflict
  - `CreateArchiveOperation`, `UnarchiveOperation`: Source validation + parent directories
- **Result**: Operations are now self-describing regarding their needs

### ✅ Phase 3: Add Prerequisite Resolution to Pipeline (DONE)
- **Created**: `pkg/synthfs/execution/prerequisite_resolver.go`
  - Implements `core.PrerequisiteResolver` interface
  - Can resolve `parent_dir` prerequisites by creating directory operations
  - Gracefully handles missing operation factories
- **Updated**: `pkg/synthfs/execution/pipeline.go`
  - Added `ResolvePrerequisites()` method to pipeline interface
  - Implements prerequisite resolution with duplicate prevention
  - Automatic dependency creation between prerequisite and dependent operations
- **Updated**: `pkg/synthfs/core/execution_types.go`
  - Added `ResolvePrerequisites bool` flag to `PipelineOptions`
- **Updated**: `pkg/synthfs/execution/executor.go`
  - Integrated prerequisite resolution into execution pipeline
  - Maintains backward compatibility (default: false)

### ✅ Phase 4: Create SimpleBatch Alternative (DONE)
- **Created**: `pkg/synthfs/batch/simple_batch.go`
  - Simplified batch implementation without hardcoded parent directory logic
  - Relies entirely on prerequisite resolution
  - No path state tracking or automatic parent creation
  - Default behavior enables prerequisite resolution
- **Updated**: Batch interfaces to support multiple implementations

### ✅ Phase 5: Migration Path (DONE)
- **Enhanced**: `pkg/synthfs/batch/batch.go` with migration options:
  - `NewBatch()`: Backward-compatible (legacy behavior)
  - `NewBatchWithSimpleBatch()`: New behavior enabled
  - `NewBatchWithLegacyBehavior()`: Explicitly legacy (deprecated)
  - `WithSimpleBatch(bool)`: Runtime switching capability
- **Added**: Multiple execution methods:
  - `RunWithPrerequisites()`: Force prerequisite resolution
  - `RunWithPrerequisitesAndBudget()`: Prerequisites + backup
- **Result**: Smooth migration path with multiple options for adoption

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Improvements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Operations declare needs, pipeline resolves them
2. **Extensibility**: New operation types only need to implement `Prerequisites()`
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: Strict package hierarchy maintained
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clean boundaries using `interface{}` where needed

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing APIs continue to work unchanged
- Default behavior preserves legacy parent directory creation
- Gradual migration path with multiple adoption strategies
- No breaking changes introduced in core interfaces

### Code Quality
- Interface-driven design with clear responsibilities
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Type-safe operations with runtime interface assertions
- Consistent naming conventions and documentation

## Remaining Work

### Phase 6: Switch Defaults (Future)
- Change `UseSimpleBatch` default to `true`
- Add deprecation notices to legacy methods
- Update internal usage patterns
- Migrate tests to new patterns

### Phase 7: Cleanup (Future Major Version)
- Remove legacy batch implementation
- Remove compatibility flags
- Simplify codebase architecture
- Remove old test patterns

## Migration Guide

### For New Projects
```go
// Recommended: Use SimpleBatch with prerequisite resolution
batch := batch.NewSimpleBatch(fs, registry)
result, err := batch.Run() // Prerequisites resolved automatically
```

### For Existing Projects
```go
// Option 1: Enable new behavior explicitly
batch := batch.NewBatch(fs, registry).WithSimpleBatch(true)

// Option 2: Use prerequisite resolution with legacy batch
batch := batch.NewBatch(fs, registry)
result, err := batch.RunWithPrerequisites()

// Option 3: Stay with legacy behavior (deprecated)
batch := batch.NewBatchWithLegacyBehavior(fs, registry)
```

## Testing Status

- ⚠️ **Needs Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests for prerequisite resolution
- ⚠️ **Needs Testing**: SimpleBatch behavior validation
- ⚠️ **Needs Testing**: Migration path edge cases
- ✅ **Existing Tests**: All legacy behavior tests continue to pass

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Batch no longer has hardcoded operation type strings** - SimpleBatch eliminates hardcoded logic
✅ **Operations explicitly declare all prerequisites** - All operations implement Prerequisites()
✅ **New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline** - Generic prerequisite resolution
✅ **All existing tests pass throughout migration** - Backward compatibility maintained
✅ **No circular import issues introduced** - Strict package hierarchy enforced

## Conclusion

The prerequisite-driven execution design has been successfully implemented with full backward compatibility. The refactoring provides a clean separation of concerns, improved extensibility, and a smooth migration path for users. Phases 1-5 are complete, establishing the foundation for the new architecture while maintaining full compatibility with existing code.

The implementation follows the design principles outlined in `new-execution.md` and provides multiple adoption strategies for different use cases. The next steps (Phases 6-7) can be implemented in future releases to fully transition to the new design as the default behavior.
