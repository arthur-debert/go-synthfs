# Execution Refactoring Summary - COMPLETED

**Status: REFACTORING COMPLETED ✅**

The execution refactoring has been successfully completed. All backwards compatibility code has been removed and the codebase now uses a single, clean implementation with automatic prerequisite resolution.

## Final Implementation

The synthfs batch system now provides:

1. **Single Implementation**: Unified `BatchImpl` with prerequisite resolution enabled by default
2. **Automatic Dependencies**: Operations declare prerequisites, system resolves them automatically
3. **Clean Architecture**: No feature flags, no migration paths, no legacy code
4. **Extensible Design**: New operation types work automatically by implementing `Prerequisites()`

## Key Changes Completed

### ✅ Core Prerequisites System
- Added prerequisite interfaces and implementations to `core/` package
- Operations declare their needs through `Prerequisites()` method
- Prerequisite resolver automatically creates missing operations

### ✅ Operation Updates
- All operations implement `Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite`
- Operations declare their needs explicitly (parent directories, no conflicts, etc.)
- No hardcoded operation knowledge in batch/pipeline layers

### ✅ Unified Implementation
- Single `BatchImpl` that uses prerequisite resolution by default
- Removed all backwards compatibility implementations
- Simplified API with single `NewBatch()` constructor

### ✅ Documentation Cleanup
- Updated all documentation to reflect final implementation
- Removed migration guides (no longer needed)
- Simplified API documentation

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ **Batch no longer has hardcoded operation type strings**: Operations are created generically
- ✅ **Operations explicitly declare all prerequisites**: All operations implement `Prerequisites()`
- ✅ **New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline**: Prerequisites interface enables this
- ✅ **Clean, maintainable codebase**: No feature flags or legacy compatibility layers
- ✅ **Comprehensive test coverage**: All functionality is well-tested

## Current API

```go
// Create a new batch (single constructor)
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()

// Add operations - prerequisites resolved automatically
batch.CreateFile("deep/nested/file.txt", []byte("content"))
batch.CreateDir("another/path")
batch.Copy("source.txt", "dest/target.txt")

// Execute with automatic dependency resolution
result, err := batch.Run()

// Or with backup enabled
result, err := batch.RunRestorable()
```

## Benefits Realized

1. **Extensibility**: Adding new operations requires only implementing the operation interface
2. **Testability**: Clean separation of concerns between operation creation and execution  
3. **Maintainability**: Prerequisites are explicit and declarative
4. **Flexibility**: Operations can declare complex prerequisite combinations
5. **Simplicity**: Single implementation path, no confusing options

## Removed Features

All backwards compatibility features have been removed:

- ❌ `UseSimpleBatch` flags and options
- ❌ `SimpleBatch` separate implementation
- ❌ Migration methods and constructors  
- ❌ Legacy batch implementations
- ❌ Feature flags and runtime switches
- ❌ Deprecated methods and compatibility layers

## Prerequisites System

Operations declare what they need:

```go
func (op *CreateFileOperation) Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite {
    var prereqs []core.Prerequisite
    
    // Need parent directory to exist
    if filepath.Dir(op.path) != "." {
        prereqs = append(prereqs, core.NewParentDirPrerequisite(op.path))
    }
    
    // Need no conflict with existing files
    prereqs = append(prereqs, core.NewNoConflictPrerequisite(op.path))
    
    return prereqs
}
```

The execution pipeline automatically resolves them during `batch.Run()`.

## Implementation Notes

### Files Modified/Created
- **Kept**: `pkg/synthfs/batch/batch.go` - Unified batch implementation
- **Kept**: `pkg/synthfs/core/prerequisites.go` - Prerequisite interfaces
- **Kept**: `pkg/synthfs/core/prerequisites_impl.go` - Concrete prerequisites  
- **Kept**: `pkg/synthfs/execution/prerequisite_resolver.go` - Resolution logic
- **Cleaned**: All other files updated to remove backwards compatibility

### Test Coverage
All functionality is comprehensively tested with the new implementation:
- Prerequisite resolution tests
- Integration tests for all operation types
- Edge case handling
- Error conditions and validation

## Result

The execution refactoring has delivered a significantly cleaner, more maintainable codebase with automatic prerequisite resolution for all filesystem operations. The implementation successfully achieves the original goals while eliminating complexity and technical debt.
