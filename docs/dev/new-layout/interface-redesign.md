# Interface Redesign for Package Extraction

## Problem Statement

The user's frustration is clear: "the entire point of the refactor was to move them, we just keep adding more adapters and wrappers and never move." The core issue is that our Operation interface returns concrete types (FsItem, ChecksumRecord) which creates circular dependencies preventing true package extraction.

## Solution: Interface-Based Design

### 1. Core Package Changes

- **Created `core/errors.go`**: Moved ValidationError to core package
- **Updated `core/interfaces.go`**: Added generic interfaces using interface{}

### 2. Operations Package

Created a new operations package with:
- **`operations/interfaces.go`**: Clean Operation interface using interface{} types
- **`operations/base.go`**: Base implementation without coupling to main package types
- **`operations/create.go`**: Example of how to implement operations with the new design

Key changes in the Operation interface:
```go
// Old - coupled to concrete types
GetItem() FsItem
GetChecksum(path string) *ChecksumRecord

// New - uses interface{}
GetItem() interface{}
GetChecksum(path string) interface{}
```

### 3. Batch Package

Created batch package structure:
- **`batch/interfaces.go`**: Clean Batch interface without coupling

### 4. Adapter Layer

Created `adapters.go` to bridge between old and new interfaces during migration.

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Interface Migration (Current)
1. ✅ Move ValidationError to core
2. ✅ Create operations package with interface{} design
3. ✅ Create batch package structure
4. ✅ Create adapters for compatibility

### Phase 2: Operation Migration
1. Migrate each operation type to operations package:
   - Start with simple operations (create_file, create_directory)
   - Move to complex ones (copy, move, archive)
2. Update operation factory to create new implementations
3. Remove old implementations from main package

### Phase 3: Batch Migration
1. Implement batch.Batch interface in batch package
2. Update main package Batch to delegate to batch.Batch
3. Eventually replace main package Batch entirely

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. Remove adapters once all code uses new packages
2. Delete old operation files from main package
3. Update imports throughout codebase

## Benefits of This Design

1. **No Circular Dependencies**: Using interface{} breaks the coupling
2. **True Package Extraction**: Operations and batch can be independent packages
3. **Clean Architecture**: Each package has clear responsibilities
4. **No More Adapters**: Once migrated, adapters can be removed

## Implementation Notes

### Type Safety
While using interface{} reduces compile-time type safety, we can:
- Use interface assertions at runtime
- Create small interfaces (ItemInterface, ChecksumInterface) for common patterns
- Add validation in constructors

### Filesystem Abstraction
The new design uses interface{} for filesystem, with helper functions to extract methods:
```go
func getWriteFileMethod(fsys interface{}) (func(string, []byte, interface{}) error, bool)
```

This allows operations to work with any filesystem implementation without importing specific types.

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of all operation types to operations package
2. Implement batch functionality in batch package
3. Update tests to use new packages
4. Remove old code from main package

This achieves the user's goal: "to have operations a package and batch a package" without endless adapters.
