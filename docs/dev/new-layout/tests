# Test Mapping for SynthFS Restructuring

This document maps existing tests to the new package structure as outlined in `README.txt`.

## Targets Tests

- `pkg/synthfs/items_test.go` -> `pkg/synthfs/targets/file_test.go`, `pkg/synthfs/targets/directory_test.go`, `pkg/synthfs/targets/symlink_test.go`, `pkg/synthfs/targets/archive_test.go`
  - Split based on the item type being tested

## Operations Tests

- `pkg/synthfs/operation_test.go` will be split into:
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/create_test.go` - file/directory/symlink creation tests
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/copy_test.go` - copy operation tests
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/move_test.go` - move operation tests
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/delete_test.go` - delete operation tests
  - `pkg/synthfs/operations/archive_test.go` - archive/unarchive tests

- `pkg/synthfs/unarchive_test.go` -> `pkg/synthfs/operations/archive_test.go`
  - All unarchiving tests
