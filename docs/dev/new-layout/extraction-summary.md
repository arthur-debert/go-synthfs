# Extraction Summary - Architectural Refactoring

## Successfully Extracted Packages

### ✅ **execution** package
- **Files moved**: executor.go, pipeline.go, state.go
- **Status**: Fully extracted with clean interfaces
- **Main package**: Contains thin wrappers for backward compatibility

### ✅ **targets** package  
- **Files moved**: file.go, directory.go, symlink.go, archive.go, interface.go, types.go
- **Status**: Fully extracted, no dependencies on main package
- **Main package**: Uses targets directly

### ✅ **filesystem** package
- **Files moved**: interfaces.go, os.go, wrapper.go
- **Status**: Fully extracted with clean interfaces
- **Main package**: Type aliases for backward compatibility

### ✅ **validation** package
- **Files moved**: checksum.go
- **Status**: Fully extracted
- **Main package**: Type alias for ChecksumRecord

### ✅ **core** package
- **Files moved**: Basic types and interfaces
- **Status**: Foundation package with no dependencies
- **Contents**: OperationID, OperationDesc, OperationStatus, BackupData, etc.

## Files Remaining in Main Package

### ❌ **batch.go**
- **Reason**: Tightly coupled with Operation interface and main package types
- **Dependencies**: Operation, ValidationError, ChecksumRecord, FsItem
- **Decision**: Keep in main package as part of public API

### ❌ **operation_*.go files**
- **Files**: 
  - operation_simple.go
  - operation_create.go
  - operation_copy_move.go
  - operation_delete.go
  - operation_archive.go
  - operation_reverse.go
- **Reason**: Implement Operation interface which depends on main package types
- **Dependencies**: FsItem, ChecksumRecord, ValidationError
- **Decision**: Keep in main package with operations

### ✅ **Wrapper files** (not duplicates)
- executor.go - Wraps execution.Executor
- pipeline.go - Wraps execution.Pipeline  
- state.go - Wraps execution.PathStateTracker
- types.go - Type aliases and main interfaces

## Architecture Achievements

1. **Clean Core Package**: Foundational types with no dependencies
2. **Independent Packages**: targets, filesystem, validation are fully independent
3. **Execution Separation**: Core execution logic separated from main package
4. **Event System**: Clean event bus implementation in core package
5. **Type Safety**: Maintained through wrapper pattern

## Limitations Encountered

1. **Circular Dependencies**: Operation interface creates circular dependency if moved
2. **Type System**: Go's type system doesn't allow interface{} to satisfy concrete types
3. **API Surface**: Batch and Operation are part of the public API and need main package types

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully extracted all packages that could be cleanly separated. The remaining files in the main package (batch.go and operation_*.go) are there by design, not oversight. They form the public API surface and depend on types that would create circular dependencies if moved.

The architecture now has:
- Clear separation of concerns
- No unnecessary duplication  
- Clean package boundaries where possible
- Wrapper pattern for backward compatibility

This represents the maximum extraction possible given Go's type system constraints and the existing API design.
