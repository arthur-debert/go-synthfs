# Execution Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the completed execution refactoring work based on the new-execution.md design document.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Add Prerequisites to Core ✅ (DONE)

**Goal**: Introduce prerequisite types without changing existing behavior

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Added `core/prerequisites.go` with interfaces
- ✅ Added `core/prerequisites_impl.go` with concrete types (ParentDirPrerequisite, NoConflictPrerequisite, SourceExistsPrerequisite)
- ✅ Added default `Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite { return nil }` to operations.BaseOperation
- ✅ All existing tests pass, no behavior change

### Phase 2: Operations Declare Prerequisites ✅ (DONE)

**Goal**: Operations declare needs, but batch still handles them

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Updated CreateFileOperation to return ParentDirPrerequisite
- ✅ Updated all operations (CreateDirectory, Copy, Move, Delete, CreateSymlink, CreateArchive, Unarchive) to declare prerequisites
- ✅ Added unit tests for prerequisite declarations in `operations/prerequisites_test.go`
- ✅ All new tests for prerequisites pass, existing tests still pass

### Phase 3: Add Prerequisite Resolution to Pipeline ✅ (DONE)

**Goal**: Pipeline can resolve prerequisites, but feature is opt-in

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Created `execution/prerequisite_resolver.go` with working resolver
- ✅ Added resolver that can create parent directory operations
- ✅ Added `ResolvePrerequisites bool` option to PipelineOptions
- ✅ When false (Phase 5 default), use existing batch behavior
- ✅ When true (Phase 6 default), resolve prerequisites automatically
- ✅ Added tests for new resolver, existing tests unchanged

### Phase 4: Create SimpleBatch Alternative ✅ (DONE)

**Goal**: New simplified batch that doesn't handle prerequisites

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Created `batch/simple_batch.go` as new implementation
- ✅ No parent dir logic in SimpleBatch, just creates operations
- ✅ Added `NewSimpleBatch()` constructor
- ✅ Existing `NewBatch()` returns current implementation
- ✅ SimpleBatch relies on pipeline prerequisite resolution
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests in `batch/simple_batch_test.go`

### Phase 5: Migration Path ✅ (DONE)

**Goal**: Allow gradual migration to new design

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Added `UseSimpleBatch bool` to PipelineOptions
- ✅ When true, use SimpleBatch + prerequisite resolution
- ✅ When false, use existing behavior
- ✅ Added delegation logic in BatchImpl.RunWithOptions
- ✅ Added RunWithSimpleBatch() and RunWithSimpleBatchAndBudget() methods
- ✅ Added migration tests in `batch/migration_test.go`

### Phase 6: Switch Defaults ✅ (DONE)

**Goal**: Make new behavior default, deprecate old

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Changed `UseSimpleBatch` default to true (new behavior is now default)
- ✅ Added deprecation notices in method comments
- ✅ Added RunWithLegacyBatch() and RunWithLegacyBatchAndBudget() for backward compatibility
- ✅ Updated all batch interfaces to include new methods
- ✅ Added Phase 6 tests in `batch/phase6_test.go`

### Phase 7: Cleanup (PENDING)

**Goal**: Remove old implementation

**Remaining Work**:
- ❌ Remove old batch implementation
- ❌ Remove compatibility flags
- ❌ Simplify codebase
- ❌ Remove old test paths

## Architecture Achieved

### Package Hierarchy

The strict package hierarchy was maintained to prevent circular imports:

```
core/           (no imports from synthfs) ✅
    ↑
operations/     (imports core only) ✅
    ↑
execution/      (imports core only) ✅
    ↑
batch/          (imports core, operations) ✅
    ↑
synthfs/        (imports all) ✅
```

### Key Components

1. **Prerequisites System** ✅
   - `core.Prerequisite` interface for declaring conditions
   - `core.PrerequisiteResolver` for resolving prerequisites
   - Concrete implementations: ParentDirPrerequisite, NoConflictPrerequisite, SourceExistsPrerequisite

2. **Enhanced Operations** ✅
   - All operations implement `Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite`
   - Operations declare their needs explicitly
   - No hardcoded operation knowledge in batch/pipeline

3. **SimpleBatch Implementation** ✅
   - Clean, simple operation creation without auto-dependency logic
   - Relies on pipeline prerequisite resolution
   - Default behavior as of Phase 6

4. **Migration Compatibility** ✅
   - Gradual migration path from Phase 5 to Phase 6
   - Legacy methods for backward compatibility
   - Clear migration documentation

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ **Batch no longer has hardcoded operation type strings**: SimpleBatch focuses on operation creation
- ✅ **Operations explicitly declare all prerequisites**: All operations implement Prerequisites()
- ✅ **New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline**: Prerequisites interface enables this
- ✅ **All existing tests pass throughout migration**: Maintained backward compatibility
- ✅ **No circular import issues introduced**: Strict package hierarchy maintained

## Migration Guide

### For Users (As of Phase 6)

**Default Behavior (Recommended)**:
```go
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()
result, err := batch.Run() // Uses SimpleBatch by default
```

**Legacy Behavior (If Needed)**:
```go
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()
result, err := batch.RunWithLegacyBatch() // Uses old batch logic
```

**Explicit Control**:
```go
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()
opts := map[string]interface{}{
    "use_simple_batch": false, // Override default
}
result, err := batch.RunWithOptions(opts)
```

### For Developers

**Creating New Operations**:
1. Implement the `operations.Operation` interface
2. Implement `Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite` to declare needs
3. Operations will work automatically with both batch implementations

**Adding New Prerequisites**:
1. Create new prerequisite type implementing `core.Prerequisite`
2. Add resolution logic to `execution.PrerequisiteResolver` if resolvable
3. Operations can use the new prerequisite immediately

## Benefits Realized

1. **Extensibility**: Adding new operations no longer requires batch modifications
2. **Testability**: Clean separation of concerns between operation creation and execution
3. **Maintainability**: Prerequisites are explicit and declarative
4. **Flexibility**: Operations can declare complex prerequisite combinations
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work with minimal changes

## Next Steps (Phase 7)

Once all users have migrated to the new system:
1. Remove legacy batch implementation
2. Remove UseSimpleBatch compatibility flag
3. Simplify interfaces and remove deprecated methods
4. Clean up test suites to focus on new implementation

This will result in a significantly cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
