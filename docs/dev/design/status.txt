This document contains the implementation status for the docs/dev/design/README.md planning.
This is a plain text only document, no markdown.

How we work. 
For each master phase we'll crete a branch and a pr. 
for example, when in phase 3, we will use the impl/phase-3/initial-work branch. 
subitems must be sepparated by commits. 

commit messages must have a Phase X.Y: <thing done> 

when each master phase is done, you can submmit to review by me. 
gotestsum -> scrpits/test must always pass.

As you finish any subphase / phase, mark them with the done checkmark (✓

1. Phase 1: Core Foundation
    1.1 Define core interfaces based on io/fs (ReadFS, WriteFS, FileSystem) ✓
    1.2 Implement basic operations (Create, Delete, Copy, Move) with dependency support ✓
    1.3 Build simple executor with dependency resolution ✓
    1.4 Create operation builders with chainable API (partial)

2. Phase 2: Advanced Features
    2.1 Add dependency resolution with topological sorting ✓
    2.2 Implement conflict detection for concurrent operations ✓
    2.3 Add transactional rollback support ✓
    2.4 Implement operation validation with rich error types ✓

3. Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
    3.1 Create io/fs compatible filesystem implementations (partial)
    3.2 Implement testing utilities with testing/fstest integration (partial)
    3.3 Create CLI tool with operation serialization
    3.4 Add progress reporting and streaming execution

4. Phase 4: Production Features
    4.1 Add observability hooks (logging only, use zerolog, have a universal log level for the library)
    4.2 Add comprehensive examples and documentation, good
    4.3 Create integration guides for popular frameworks, pick 2 only.
