# go-synthfs Implementation Status

## Completed Phases ✓

### Phase 1: Core Foundation ✓
✓ 1.1: Core interfaces and types
✓ 1.2: Basic operations (CreateFile, CreateDir) 
✓ 1.3: Simple executor
✓ 1.4: Operation builders with chainable API

### Phase 2: Advanced Features ✓
✓ 2.1: Dependency resolution with topological sorting
✓ 2.2: Conflict detection for concurrent operations
✓ 2.3: Transactional rollback support
✓ 2.4: Rich error types (ValidationError, DependencyError, ConflictError)

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration ✓
✓ 3.1: io/fs compatible filesystem implementations
✓ 3.2: Testing utilities with testing/fstest integration  
✓ 3.3: CLI tool with operation serialization
✓ 3.4: Progress reporting and streaming execution

### Phase 4: Production Features (In Progress)
✓ 4.1: Observability - Logging
  ✓ 4.1a: Central logging infrastructure with zerolog
  ✓ 4.1b: Info-level logging for operation flow visibility
  ✓ 4.1c: Debug-level logging for branching logic and validation
  ✓ 4.1d: Trace-level logging with full data dumps
◯ 4.2: Performance optimization and benchmarking
◯ 4.3: Comprehensive examples and documentation
◯ 4.4: Integration guides for popular frameworks

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 4.1 Logging - COMPLETED ✓
- Comprehensive logging infrastructure using zerolog
- 4 logging levels: Info (flow), Debug (decisions), Trace (data dumps), Warn (default)
- Central configuration with application-controllable log levels
- Test integration with -v flag mapping (warn/info/debug/trace)
- Complete operation lifecycle logging with structured fields
- Detailed validation and dependency resolution logging
- Full data dumps at trace level for complete debugging
- Developer documentation with usage examples and configuration guide

## Next Steps
- Phase 4.2: Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Phase 4.3: Documentation and examples
- Phase 4.4: Integration guides
