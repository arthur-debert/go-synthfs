# Batch Execution Refactoring - COMPLETED

## Overview

This document describes the completed refactoring of the batch execution system to support prerequisite-driven operation resolution. The refactoring has been completed and all backwards compatibility code has been removed.

## Final Implementation

The batch system now uses a single, clean implementation that:

1. **Prerequisite Resolution**: All operations declare their prerequisites (e.g., parent directory existence) and the system automatically resolves them by creating additional operations
2. **Clean Design**: Single `BatchImpl` implementation without feature flags or migration paths
3. **Automatic Dependencies**: Operations like `CreateFile` automatically get parent directory creation if needed
4. **Unified API**: Simple `NewBatch()` constructor returns the unified implementation

## Key Changes Made

### ✅ **Phase 1-3: Prerequisites System**
- Added prerequisite interfaces and implementations to `core/` package
- Operations declare their prerequisites through `Prerequisites()` method
- Prerequisite resolver automatically creates missing operations

### ✅ **Phase 4-7: Implementation & Migration**
- Implemented prerequisite resolution in execution pipeline
- Created unified batch implementation
- Added comprehensive test coverage

### ✅ **Cleanup: Backwards Compatibility Removal**
- Removed all feature flags and migration code
- Consolidated to single `BatchImpl` implementation  
- Cleaned up API to use simple `NewBatch()` constructor
- Removed deprecated files: `simple_batch.go`, `options.go`, `factory.go`
- Updated documentation to reflect final clean design

## Current API

```go
// Create a new batch with prerequisite resolution
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()

// Add operations - prerequisites are automatically resolved
fileOp, _ := batch.CreateFile("deep/path/file.txt", []byte("content"))
dirOp, _ := batch.CreateDir("another/deep/path")

// Execute with automatic dependency resolution
result, err := batch.Run()
```

## Test Status

All tests pass with the new implementation:
- ✅ Prerequisite resolution tests
- ✅ Integration tests  
- ✅ Backwards compatibility removed
- ✅ Documentation updated

## Implementation Notes

The final implementation is significantly cleaner than the original design:

1. **No Feature Flags**: Single implementation path
2. **Automatic Prerequisites**: No manual dependency management needed
3. **Clean API**: Simple constructor and methods
4. **Full Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for all functionality

This refactoring successfully delivers the goal of prerequisite-driven operation resolution while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase.
