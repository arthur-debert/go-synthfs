# Migration Guide: Execution Refactoring - COMPLETED

**Status: MIGRATION COMPLETED ✅**

The execution refactoring has been completed successfully. All backwards compatibility code has been removed and there is now a single, clean implementation.

## Summary of Changes

The execution refactoring introduced prerequisite-driven operation handling:

- **Old Approach**: Hardcoded parent directory creation in batch implementation
- **New Approach**: Operations declare prerequisites, execution pipeline resolves them automatically

## Current Implementation

The synthfs batch system now has a single, unified implementation that:

1. **Uses prerequisite resolution by default**: All operations automatically get their prerequisites resolved
2. **Provides clean architecture**: Operations declare what they need, the system provides it
3. **Supports all filesystem operations**: Files, directories, archives, symlinks, copy/move/delete

## Updated API

```go
// Create a new batch (only constructor now available)
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()

// Add operations - prerequisites are automatically resolved
batch.CreateFile("deep/nested/file.txt", []byte("content"))
batch.CreateDir("another/deep/path")

// Execute with automatic dependency resolution
result, err := batch.Run()
```

## Migration Complete

**No migration is needed** - the codebase has been consolidated to use the new prerequisite-driven approach as the only implementation.

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Extensibility**: New operation types just implement `Prerequisites()`
2. **Testability**: Each component has single responsibility
3. **Maintainability**: No hardcoded operation knowledge in batch
4. **Flexibility**: Operations can declare complex prerequisites
5. **Clean API**: Single constructor, consistent behavior

## Prerequisites System

Operations now declare what they need:

```go
func (op *CreateFileOperation) Prerequisites() []core.Prerequisite {
    var prereqs []core.Prerequisite
    
    // Need parent directory to exist
    if filepath.Dir(op.path) != "." {
        prereqs = append(prereqs, core.NewParentDirPrerequisite(op.path))
    }
    
    // Need no conflict with existing files
    prereqs = append(prereqs, core.NewNoConflictPrerequisite(op.path))
    
    return prereqs
}
```

The execution pipeline automatically resolves them during `batch.Run()`.

### Available Prerequisites

- `core.ParentDirPrerequisite`: Parent directory must exist
- `core.NoConflictPrerequisite`: Path must not conflict with existing files
- `core.SourceExistsPrerequisite`: Source path must exist (for copy/move/delete)

## Example Operations

### Creating Nested Files

```go
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()
batch.CreateFile("deep/nested/file.txt", content)
batch.Run() // Automatically creates deep/ and deep/nested/ directories
```

### Complex Directory Structures

```go
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()
batch.CreateFile("a/b/c/file1.txt", content1)
batch.CreateFile("a/b/d/file2.txt", content2)
batch.Run() // Prerequisites resolved: creates a/, a/b/, a/b/c/, a/b/d/
```

### Archives and Symlinks

```go
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()
batch.CreateSymlink("target.txt", "deep/path/link.txt")
batch.CreateArchive("archive.tar.gz", synthfs.TarGz, "file1.txt", "file2.txt")
batch.Run() // All prerequisites resolved automatically
```

## Removed Features

The following backwards compatibility features have been removed:

- ❌ `UseSimpleBatch` flags and options
- ❌ Migration methods and constructors
- ❌ Legacy batch implementations
- ❌ Feature flags and runtime switches

## Result

The codebase is now significantly cleaner with a single, well-tested implementation that provides automatic prerequisite resolution for all filesystem operations.
