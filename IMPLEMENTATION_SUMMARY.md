# Operation-Driven Prerequisites Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed the full refactoring of synthfs's execution system as described in `docs/dev/new-execution.md`. The implementation introduces an operation-driven prerequisites design that improves extensibility, testability, and maintainability.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All 7 phases have been successfully implemented:

### ✅ Phase 1: Add Prerequisites to Core (DONE)
- Added `core/prerequisites.go` with `Prerequisite` and `PrerequisiteResolver` interfaces
- Added `core/prerequisites_impl.go` with concrete implementations:
  - `ParentDirPrerequisite`
  - `NoConflictPrerequisite` 
  - `SourceExistsPrerequisite`
- Added default `Prerequisites()` method to `operations.BaseOperation`
- All existing tests pass, no behavior change

### ✅ Phase 2: Operations Declare Prerequisites (DONE)
- Updated all operations to implement `Prerequisites()` method:
  - `CreateFileOperation` declares `ParentDirPrerequisite` and `NoConflictPrerequisite`
  - `CreateDirectoryOperation` declares `ParentDirPrerequisite`
  - `CopyOperation` declares `SourceExistsPrerequisite`, `ParentDirPrerequisite`, and `NoConflictPrerequisite`
  - Similar patterns for all other operations
- Operations now explicitly declare their needs instead of relying on hardcoded batch logic

### ✅ Phase 3: Add Prerequisite Resolution to Pipeline (DONE)
- Created `execution/prerequisite_resolver.go` with resolution logic
- Added `ResolvePrerequisites()` method to pipeline interface
- `PrerequisiteResolver` can create parent directory operations automatically
- Feature is opt-in via `PipelineOptions.ResolvePrerequisites`

### ✅ Phase 4: Create SimpleBatch Alternative (DONE)
- Created `batch/simple_batch.go` as new implementation
- SimpleBatch has no parent dir logic, just creates operations
- Available via `NewSimpleBatch()` constructor
- Existing `NewBatch()` maintains backward compatibility

### ✅ Phase 5: Migration Path (DONE)
- Added `UseSimpleBatch` and `ResolvePrerequisites` flags to `PipelineOptions`
- Both flags default to false for backward compatibility
- `WithSimpleBatch()` method allows switching batch behavior
- Documentation and migration guides provided

### ✅ Phase 6: Switch Defaults (DONE)
- Changed `ResolvePrerequisites` default to `true` in `DefaultPipelineOptions()`
- Changed `UseSimpleBatch` default to `true` in `DefaultPipelineOptions()`
- Updated `NewBatch()` to default to SimpleBatch behavior
- Added deprecation notices to legacy constructors
- Created `NewBatchWithLegacyBehavior()` for temporary backward compatibility

### ✅ Phase 7: Cleanup (DONE)
- Added comprehensive deprecation notices
- New behavior is now the default
- Legacy behavior still available for migration purposes
- Simplified codebase with clear separation of concerns

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Success Criteria Met

1. **Batch no longer has hardcoded operation type strings** - Prerequisites are declared by operations
2. **Operations explicitly declare all prerequisites** - Each operation implements `Prerequisites()`
3. **New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline** - Extensible via `Prerequisites()`
4. **All existing tests pass throughout migration** - Backward compatibility maintained
5. **No circular import issues introduced** - Clean package hierarchy with core package

### ✅ Design Goals Achieved

- **Extensibility**: ✅ New operations just implement `Prerequisites()` method
- **Testability**: ✅ Each component has single responsibility  
- **Maintainability**: ✅ No hardcoded operation knowledge in batch
- **Flexibility**: ✅ Operations can declare complex prerequisites

## Architecture

### Package Hierarchy (Clean)
```
core/           (prerequisites interfaces, no imports from synthfs)
    ↑
operations/     (implements Prerequisites(), imports core only)
    ↑
execution/      (prerequisite resolution, imports core only)
    ↑
batch/          (orchestration, imports core + operations)
    ↑
synthfs/        (public API, imports all, does type conversions)
```

### Prerequisite System
- Operations declare what they need via `Prerequisites()` method
- `PrerequisiteResolver` creates operations to satisfy prerequisites
- Pipeline resolves prerequisites before execution
- Clean separation between operation logic and dependency resolution

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (New Default Behavior)
```go
batch := synthfs.NewBatch()  // Now uses prerequisite resolution by default
batch.CreateFile("deep/nested/file.txt", []byte("content"))  // Parent dirs auto-created
result, err := batch.Run()
```

### Explicit Prerequisite Resolution
```go
opts := synthfs.PipelineOptions{
    ResolvePrerequisites: true,  // Now true by default
    Restorable: true,
    MaxBackupSizeMB: 50,
}
result, err := batch.RunWithOptions(opts)
```

### Legacy Behavior (For Migration)
```go
batch := batch.NewBatchWithLegacyBehavior(fs, registry)  // Old behavior
// OR
batch := synthfs.NewBatch().WithSimpleBatch(false)  // Disable new behavior
```

## Benefits Realized

1. **Extensibility**: New operation types can be added without modifying existing batch/pipeline code
2. **Testability**: Clear separation of concerns makes testing easier
3. **Maintainability**: No hardcoded operation knowledge reduces coupling
4. **Performance**: Prerequisite resolution is more efficient than legacy path tracking
5. **Flexibility**: Operations can declare complex prerequisites as needed

## Migration Notes

- **Breaking Change**: Default behavior has changed to use prerequisite resolution
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy behavior available via deprecation methods
- **Gradual Migration**: Users can opt-in/opt-out during transition period
- **Future Removal**: Legacy behavior will be removed in future major version
