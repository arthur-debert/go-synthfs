# Execution Refactor Complete

This document summarizes the successful completion of the operation-driven prerequisites design as described in `docs/dev/new-execution.md`.

## Summary

The execution refactor has been successfully completed, implementing a clean operation-driven prerequisites system that eliminates hardcoded operation logic from the batch layer.

## Phases Completed

### âœ… Phase 1: Prerequisites Core System
- Added `core/prerequisites.go` with `Prerequisite` and `PrerequisiteResolver` interfaces
- Added `core/prerequisites_impl.go` with concrete implementations:
  - `ParentDirPrerequisite` - ensures parent directories exist
  - `NoConflictPrerequisite` - prevents overwriting existing files  
  - `SourceExistsPrerequisite` - validates source files exist
- Added default `Prerequisites()` method to `operations.BaseOperation`

### âœ… Phase 2: Operation Integration
- All operations now implement `Prerequisites()` method:
  - `CreateFileOperation` - requires parent dir and no conflicts
  - `CreateDirectoryOperation` - requires parent dir and no conflicts
  - `CopyOperation` - requires source exists, parent dir, no conflicts
  - `MoveOperation` - requires source exists, parent dir, no conflicts  
  - `DeleteOperation` - requires source exists
  - `CreateSymlinkOperation` - requires parent dir and no conflicts
  - `CreateArchiveOperation` - requires source files exist, parent dir, no conflicts
  - `UnarchiveOperation` - requires source exists, parent dir
- Comprehensive test coverage in `operations/prerequisites_test.go`

### âœ… Phase 3: Pipeline Resolution
- Added `execution/prerequisite_resolver.go` with `PrerequisiteResolver` implementation
- Added `ResolvePrerequisites()` method to `execution/pipeline.go`
- Added `ResolvePrerequisites` option to `core.PipelineOptions`
- Pipeline can automatically create parent directory operations to satisfy prerequisites

### âœ… Phase 4: SimpleBatch Implementation  
- Created `batch/simple_batch.go` with `SimpleBatchImpl`
- SimpleBatch does NOT automatically create parent directories
- SimpleBatch relies on prerequisite resolution for dependency management
- SimpleBatch enables prerequisite resolution by default in `Run()` method
- Full API compatibility with regular batch interface

### âœ… Phase 5-6: Migration Path (Simplified)
- Added migration options to `core.PipelineOptions` (`UseSimpleBatch`)
- Regular batch can delegate to SimpleBatch when option is enabled
- Migration path was simplified to go directly to unified approach
- Backward compatibility maintained through deprecated methods

### âœ… Phase 7: Unified Implementation
- Single codebase approach using prerequisite resolution consistently
- Removed complexity of maintaining parallel batch implementations  
- All batch constructors now use prerequisite resolution
- Deprecated methods maintained for API compatibility
- Clean separation of concerns between operations and batch orchestration

## Key Achievements

### 1. **Extensibility** âœ…
- New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline code
- Operations simply implement the `Prerequisites()` method
- Prerequisite resolution is handled generically by the pipeline

### 2. **Testability** âœ…  
- Each component has single responsibility
- Prerequisites can be tested independently
- Operations can be tested without batch complexity
- Pipeline resolution can be tested separately

### 3. **Maintainability** âœ…
- No hardcoded operation knowledge in batch layer
- Prerequisites are declared explicitly by operations
- Clean package hierarchy prevents circular dependencies
- Interface segregation minimizes coupling

### 4. **Flexibility** âœ…
- Operations can declare complex prerequisites
- Prerequisite validation can be cached for performance  
- Multiple prerequisite types can be combined
- Custom prerequisite resolvers can be implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Package Hierarchy
```
core/           (no imports from synthfs)
    â†‘
operations/     (imports core only)  
    â†‘
execution/      (imports core only)
    â†‘ 
batch/          (imports core, operations)
    â†‘
synthfs/        (imports all)
```

### Interface Design
- `core.Prerequisite` - declares requirements (parent_dir, no_conflict, source_exists)
- `core.PrerequisiteResolver` - creates operations to satisfy prerequisites
- `operations.Operation.Prerequisites()` - operations declare their needs
- `execution.Pipeline.ResolvePrerequisites()` - resolves prerequisites automatically

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing batch methods work unchanged
- New `SimpleBatch` provides clean alternative
- Migration path through configuration options
- Deprecated methods maintained for compatibility

## Success Criteria Met

All success criteria from the original design document have been achieved:

1. âœ… Batch no longer has hardcoded operation type strings
2. âœ… Operations explicitly declare all prerequisites  
3. âœ… New operation types can be added without modifying batch/pipeline
4. âœ… All existing tests pass throughout migration
5. âœ… No circular import issues introduced

## Performance Considerations

- Prerequisite validation results can be cached
- Dependency resolution uses efficient topological sorting
- Interface segregation minimizes runtime overhead
- Generic operation handling reduces code duplication

## Future Extensibility

The new architecture makes it easy to:

- Add new prerequisite types (e.g., permissions, disk space)
- Implement custom prerequisite resolvers
- Add new operation types with complex dependencies
- Extend validation and caching strategies
- Support operation-specific optimization hints

## Conclusion

The operation-driven prerequisites design has been successfully implemented, providing a clean, extensible, and maintainable architecture for filesystem operations. The refactor eliminates hardcoded logic while maintaining full backward compatibility and enabling future extensibility.
